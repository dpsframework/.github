> Multiagent Production Systems on JADE platform<br>
Managed autonomous and built-it Expert Systems <br> by JADE agents (or **dpsAgent** for short).

> The dpsFramework project is a free and open source Java framework  <br>
for building _Multi-Agent Production System applications_. It provides  <br>
three types of JADE agents, and a development environment made up  <br>
of a collection of internal and external scripts for the agents,  <br>
which allow the creation and maintenance of applications.  <br>
Following components are used by **dpsAgent**:


* **JADE** 4.5.4 r6868 with its **FIPA** module implemented with CORBA libraries.
* **CLIPSJNI** Java Native by **CLIPS-6.40** and **JESS**: both are Expert Systems Building Tools.
* In debug mode, the **dpsAgent** incorpores a GUI with access to Java command-line interpreter **BeanShell**, and highlighting code-editor such as **RSyntaxTextArea**.
* And optionally, OWL reasoners from the Apache-JENA framework for building Semantic Webn and Linked Data apps.

>  **dpsAgent** Java LIbrary was developed at the University of Le√≥n between 2012 and 2017 years. And it has been regulary updated until present.
    The motivation to face these enourmous  changes was caused by  advances in Java and Early-Access OpenJDK builds and the big changes made in CLIPS-6.40 version expert system  building tool.
