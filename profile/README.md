> Multiagent Production Systems on JADE platform <br>
-- Manage autonomous expert systems integrated in JADE agents --


>  The dpsFramework project and its JADE agent library **dpsAgent** was developed at the University of Le√≥n between 2012 and 2017. And it has been regularly updated up to the present.

> The dpsFramework project is now a free and open source Java framework for building multi-agent production system applications. It provides three types of JADE agents and a development environment made up of a collection of internal and external scripts used by these agents, which allow the creation and maintenance of applications.

>  However, the great changes undergone by the Oracle Java compiler from the appearance of JDK-11 to JDK-18 and the deep transformation of the expert system construction tool CLIPS version 6.40 have motivated this complete revision of **dpsAgent** Java Library and the **dpsFramework** in tis entirety.

Following components are used by **dpsFramework** agents:



* **JADE** 4.5.4 r6868 with its **FIPA** module implemented with CORBA libraries.
* **CLIPSJNI** Java Native by **CLIPS-6.40** and **JESS**: both are Expert Systems Building Tools.
* In debug mode, the **dpsAgents** incorpores a GUI with access to Java command-line interpreter **BeanShell**, and highlighting code-editor such as **RSyntaxTextArea**.
* And optionally, OWL reasoners from the Apache-JENA framework for building Semantic Web apps.
