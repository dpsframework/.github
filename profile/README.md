> Multiagent Production Systems on JADE platform <br><br>


>  The dpsFramework project and its JADE agent library **dpsAgents** was developed at the University of Le√≥n between 2012 and 2017. And it has been regularly updated up to the present.

> The dpsFramework project aims to be a free and open source Java framework for building multi-agent production system applications. It provides three types of JADE agents and a development environment made up of a collection of internal and external scripts used by these agents, to facilitate the creation and maintenance of applications.




>  However, the great changes undergone by the Oracle Java compiler from the appearance of JDK-11 to JDK-18 and the deep transformation of the expert system construction tool CLIPS version 6.40 have motivated this complete revision of **dpsAgents** Java Library and the **dpsFramework** in tis entirety. We intend to release **dpsAgents-2.1** at the end of next September 2022.



Following components are used by **dpsFramework** agents:


* **JADE** 4.5.4 r6868 with its **FIPA** module integrated with CORBA libraries.
* **CLIPSJNI** Java Native by **CLIPS-6.40** and **JESS**: Expert Systems Building Tools.
* In debug mode, the **dpsAgents** incorpores a GUI with access to:
  1. Java command-line interpreter **BeanShell**.
  1. Highlighting code-editor such as **RSyntaxTextArea**.
* And optionally, OWL reasoners from **Apache-JENA** framework for building Semantic Web apps.
