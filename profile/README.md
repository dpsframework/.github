> Problem-Solving JADE Agents connected <br>
to built-in autonomous Expert Systems: for short [**PS-Agents**].

> This project also incorporates with proven solutions, proposals <br>
to update MAS-platform, components and engines to the Java <br>
Platform JDK-17 (LTS) or OpenJDK-18 and higher. <br>
Initially, the completed and tested proposals for upgrading <br>
to JDK-17/OpenJDK-18 cover the following items used by the [PS-Agents]:

* **JADE** 4.5.4 Platform and its **FIPA** module implemented with CORBA libraries.
* **CLIPSJNI** for CLIPS-6.31 and CLIPS-6.40. As well as core of **JESS** Rule-Based engine.
* And GUI and, Java Interpreter components, such as: **RSyntaxTextArea** and, **BeanShell**.

All of them were essential for [[**PS-Agents**   v1.8]](https://github.com/dpsframework/PS-Agents-1.8/releases/tag/1.8). <br>
And half of them are still critical items in the new version [**PS-Agents**  v2.1].

>  PS-Agents were developed at the University of Le√≥n between 2012 and 2017. <br> The **motivation** to face these changes and adaptations was caused by <br>
the advances in Java and Early-Access OpenJDK Builds, from Oracle.
